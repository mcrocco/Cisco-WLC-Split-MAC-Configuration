This project demonstrates how to configure a network for a wireless deployment with a wireless LAN controller (WLC) and Lightweight Access Points (LWAP) via a Split-MAC architecture. 


<p>Environments and Technologies Used:

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco Multilayer Switches
- Cisco Command Line
- Cisco WLC
- Cisco LWAPs
- OSPF
- WLANs
- CAPWAP Tunnels
- DHCP</p>
